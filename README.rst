Penelope's First Computer Program
=================================

I had a tidy up this morning (6 March 2012) and found the logo code from this
project among my things. It's some homework Penelope completed a couple of
years ago to make and colour in a drawing of some trees. Most people used
pens and paper... we had a lot of fun doing it with logo, printing it out and
then colouring it in.
